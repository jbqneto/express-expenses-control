# Expense Importer - MVP

This project is the first version (MVP) of an expense control back-end. It is designed to be consumed by a front-end application, providing essential endpoints for managing and tracking expenses.

## Features

- Basic API endpoints for expense data.
- Data integration and redirection from n8n workflows.
- Foundation for future enhancements and direct data management.

## Roadmap

- Implement direct database connections.
- Add authentication and authorization.
- Improve error handling and validation.
